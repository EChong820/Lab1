Below is the link to my HTML map for Lab 1 featuring the distribution of academic institutions and parks across Vancouver!

Reflective Analysis:

The map created below is designed for city planners, academic institutions, students, parents, researchers, and even just the general public as a collective whole. The question that this map attempts to tackle focuses on the overall locations of academic institutions across Vancouver and its geographical location in regards to its overall accessibility and convenience to the spread of public parks and its distributional spread around the city. When it came to the intellectual justifications surrounding the thought process and decision making for not just my data but also the creation of the map, I initially wanted to put attention focusing towards Vancouver's issue on homelessness. I would analyze the various homeless shelters provided around the city with the intention of being able to provide its data attributes as well in regard to each specific location that would allow users to interact with the map in filtering based on gender, age demographics, whether meals were being provided, whether animals were allowed, etc. However, due to my inexperience and lack of skill in Mapbox, despite spending quite some time on that end - I had to put this project on a hold (where I hope to resume it in the future, potentially after my summer courses finish!) - https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/homeless-shelter-locations/information/. Ultimately, I decided to switch towards focusing on the topic of accessibility and most particularly wanted to put my attention towards the younger generation as they will be the backbone towards leading our community into a more sustainable direction and greener future. Therefore, allowing me to conclude on examining the distribution of academic institutions and public parks - allowing me to tap into multigenerations through allowing this data to contribute to the knowledge of students, parents, policymakers, and more! When designing this map, I wanted to find a simple way of portraying the data so that anyone disregarding their cartographic reading abilities, will be able to easily pick up the patterns and trends being identified. Previously when doing other assignments I noticed that mapbox studios had a feature of customizing icons and I felt that this was the perfect opportunity to implement this function when displaying a more detailed icon of academic institutions rather than putting a simple dot. I felt that it helped make the data more specific as to what exactly it may be without the users necessarily needing to  use the legend. The color choice for academic institutions - I wanted to go for a bluer tone but also maintain the neutral aspect so that it is not too distracting for the eyes. In addition when it came to green spaces, I also wanted to find a subtle tone that made it a more soothing experience for the user. Other aspects that was integrated into the map was a legend on the top right which I felt although did not add much interactability, should still be considered a necessity and an importance when it comes to including this addition. I also implemented a zoom button function which provides users with the opportunity to interact with the magnification of the map through clicking on the buttoms which also detail the total distance based off the zoom levels. When it came to designing the map based on zoom levels, my priority was to maintain the simplification and to avoid making the map hard to view for the average user. Therefore, when it came to designing the map on different zoom levels, most of it came down to interacting with the overall size across zoom range - the more zoomed in to Vancouver, the larger the icons would get - ultimately capping it at a size of 5. Despite me not being able to carry out my original plan of addressing the homeless problem in Vancouver and shifting towards a new topic of focus - the dsitrubution of academic institutions and parks across Vancouver - I am quite satisfied with this project as I felt like I did a much better job compared to other assignments when it came to being able to identify and examine an actual potential question/topic of discussion that has the potential of being useful knowledge that can genuinely contribute to research!

There are obvious ways that my map can improve given that I am not very skilled at mapbox studios/JS. However, when touching upon factors surrounding aesthetics - I do think that just basing it off my current map as of now, there are already tons of visual improvements that can be adjusted in order to make this map (although simple) stand out even more. For example, I wanted to make the formatting and allignment around the legend to be more polished and structured where it could provide a minimalistic but yet professional tone to it. When it came to accessibility and moving towards other cartographic concepts that don't fall under the visual hierarchy, there are lots of ways that this map can be improved to help further benefit ones' knowledge surrounding the question being highlighted such as through the addition of integrating a way for information to expand when being clicked on or by implementing a 3D feature that will allow users to see the actual landscape distribution.
